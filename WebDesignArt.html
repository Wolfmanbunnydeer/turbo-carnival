<div id="World of Art History" class="tabcontent">
  <h3> World of Art History</h3>
  <p>World of Art History is art studies is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of art history, 
which focus on the history of visual arts worldwide, its methodology, concepts and approach. The art info is showing the 
study of objects of art in many artist's historical development and stylistic contexts, i.e. genre, design, format, and style.
 This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects</p>
</div>

<div id="Favorite Famous Artist History" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Favorite Famous Artist History</h3>
  <p>Favorite Famous Artist History Art style follows something that exists, like Leonardo DaVinci’s choice in color, Picasso’s choice in art, or the surreal effects of Salvador Dali. When you use an art form that already exists, its art style. But when you invent a new way to depict an image, its art movement. Like when Andy Warhol glued pictures of caned soup. It wasn’t necessarily something interesting, but it was something new. Most famous artists are known to create art movements because they follow their own style rather than copying someone else.</p>
</div>

<div><div id="Art Style Movement" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Art Style Movement</h3>
  <p><b>Art Style Movement show a group of artists tend toward or immerse themselves in a particular style based on
 common goals or philosophies, this can be called a movement.Many art style has extinction to pplace belong to an artistic style of art exhibit common visual characteristics.  
This is phenomenon was particularly common among Modernist artists of the late-nineteenth- and early- to mid-twentieth centuries. 
These movements were usually of short period and localized to a particular geographic region. 
They arose under very specific historical, political, and socio-cultural circumstances. Participants of some movements such as Dada and Futurism developed formal documents called manifestos, which were published declarations of these movements’ views and intentions.

All works of art can be described in terms of style. A particular artwork may also exhibit visual 
characteristics associated with one or more of the well-known historical styles. Yet this does not necessarily mean that the artist who produced it belonged to the corresponding movement within which those styles may have originally been developed or advanced. If I make a painting in the style of the French Impressionists, it does not mean that I belong to the French Impressionist movement. My painting might be more accurately described as impressionistic; that is, derived from, influenced or inspired by, Impressionism and the Impressionists.</b></p>

<td><b><p>The elements of art are components or parts of a work of art 
that can be isolaated defining to use the building blocks create a work of art.
Horizontal lines suggest a objects parallel to the earth are at rest in this landscape to help give a sense of space. 
Vertical lines often communicate a sense of height because they are perpendicular to the earth,
extending upwards toward the sky. 
A line is an identifiable path created by a point moving in space. 
It is one-dimensional and can vary in width, direction, and length. 
The relationship of positive to negative space can greatly affect 
the impact of a work of art. 
The disproportionate amount of negative space accentuates the figure's vulnerability and isolation.
Color has three main characteristics in hue, value and intensity. 
Value describes the brightness of color. 
Artists use color value to create different moods. 
Dark colors in a composition suggest a lack of light, 
as in a night or interior scene and can often convey a sense of mystery or foreboding. 
Light colors often describe a light source or light reflected within the composition. 
In this painting, the dark colors suggest a night or interior scene. 
The artist used light colors to describe the light created by the candle flame.  
Intensity describes the purity or strength of a color. 
Bright colors are undiluted and are often associated with positive energy and heightened emotions.
Dull colors have been diluted by mixing with other colors and create a sedate or serious mood. 
In this image the artist captured both the seriousness 
and the joy of the scene with the dull gray stone interior and the bright red drapery. 
The surface quality of an object that we sense through touch. 
All objects have a physical texture. 
Artists can also convey texture visually in two dimensions.
2-D work of art and texture gives a visual sense of 
how an object depicted would feel hard, soft, rough, smooth, hairy, leathery, and sharp in real life. 
In three-dimensional works, artists use actual texture to add a tactile quality to the work. 
Artists use color, line, and shading to imply textures. 
In this painting, the man's robe is painted to simulate silk. 
The ability to convincingly portray fabric of different typical marks of a great painter during the 17th century.
The surface of this writing desk is metallic and hard.
 The hard surface is functional for an object that would have been used for writing. 
The smooth surface of the writing desk reflects light, adding sparkle to this piece of furniture.</b></p></p>
