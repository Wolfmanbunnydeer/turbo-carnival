     Artists and designers both create visual compositions using a shared knowledge base, but their reasons for doing so are entirely different.
Some designers consider themselves artists, but few artists consider themselves designers.
     Art connects with people in different ways, because it’s interpreted differently.
  For example, Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa was viewed strange face in many years when she has staring eyes.
